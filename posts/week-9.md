# Homework

**1. In what way could you consider this project to: (1) be an example of mycelial creativity? (2) belong to the aesthetic category of interesting?**
<br>

**(1) Mycelial creativity:** Mycelial creativity suggests that by tapping into the vast network of human knowledge, experiences, and cultural exchanges, we can unlock new possibilities and solutions. Similar to the growth of mushrooms—this concept underscores the importance of nourishment in the creative process. Much like mycelium absorbs nutrients from its surroundings to thrive, creativity feeds off a rich diet of intellectual and experiential inputs to lay its foundations. As mycelial networks become denser, they give rise to visible manifestations, such as mushrooms sprouting from the ground. Similarly, when creativity is sufficiently nurtured by information and experiences, it blossoms into tangible outcomes: artwork, inventions, or innovative ideas. These creations, once birthed, continue to draw sustenance from their environment, much as mushrooms mature and contribute to their ecosystem. This cycle of nurturing and being nurtured highlights the symbiotic relationship between creativity and its surroundings. Just as mycelium networks sustain and enrich the environment around them, creative outputs foster further growth and innovation, perpetuating a cycle of mutual benefit and advancement.

This project was developed from my collection of information and experiences. The karaoke concept grew from my study in Creative Coding class about the awkwardness in Ngai's aesthetics: chaotic and my personal experience of my friends singing karaoke. Inspired by the chaotic characteristic of "involves imitation and mimicry, as if trying to copy what someone else does but doing it clumsily" and is "more likely to convert triumph into failure than failure into triumph", the memories of hanging out with my friends singing karaoke came to mind. I thought of the times we tried to mimick professional singers, but accidentally produced awkward, yet fun, off-key performances. This experience highlights the tendency of karaoke singers attempting to imitate original artists, resulting in awkward and clumsy performances. It's fun because everyone simply enjoys the moment, with little concern for reaching the correct notes. That's what I wanted to capture – the fun and joy of singing, even when it's not perfect. So, this project is all about celebrating those imperfect, hilarious karaoke moments. To foster community growth, I considered adding an easy-to-use recording system and a gallery for audience members to share their performances with others.

**(2) Aesthetic category of interesting:** Ngai suggests that "interesting" represents a subtle form of engagement, characterized by a light, almost indifferent level of attention. This type of engagement captures our interest momentarily but does not demand deep emotional investment or analytical thought. Instead, it makes us curious and keep moving from one thing to the next, always seeking the next piece of stimulation.
<br>

Applying this concept to this project requires simplicity, similar to the infinite scroll feature in social media, to maintain a low-key yet sustained level of audience engagement. This approach encourages continued interaction without overwhelming the user. Developed from karaoke idea, where ambient music plays in the background, the project introduces an interactive element: moving the mouse up and down generates a 'voice' that harmonizes with the music. This design invites minimal yet meaningful participation—simply moving the mouse to produce a singing voice that encourages the audiences to sync with the background tune—encourages extended, seamless engagement, creating an endless performance experience.

**2. Brainstorm ideas regarding what community of practice you might engage with for your A3 project. Please include: its domain, shared values, existing repertoire.**
<br>

**Domain:** online audiences where they can be anonymous and like to sing
<br>

**Shared value:** like to sing
<br>

**Existing Repertoire:** internet, social media, enjoy music or sounds
<br>

**3.How you might broker some creative coding repertoire to this new context?**
<br>
Through a gallery where people can share their performances
