**1. In your own words, and using examples from the internet, draw on the readings from this week to define what "cute" is, as an aesthetic category.  Post your discussion to your blog.**
<br>

According to Ngai, ‘cute’ is one of the ‘late capitalist’ aesthetics. It is both innocent and problematic. Cuteness triggers our feelings of adoration and a desire for possession, often representing an idealized world free from conflict and negativity. Capitalism exploits this desire for a utopia by transforming cuteness into “commodity fetish” that drives consumption. Drawing from Marxist theory, a commodity fetish describes how a product’s value transcends its function. Capitalism taps into our desire for possession and utopian longing and mass-produces cute commodities to sell us that dream. Despite recognizing the manufactured nature of cuteness, we're still drawn to its innocent gaze and the promise of a perfect world. This creates a situation where we willingly participate in this commodification process.

**2. In your own words, and using examples from the internet, draw on the readings from this week to explain what "effective complexity" is, and how it functions within a cute aesthetic frame.**
<br>

Complexity is randomness and without any orders. Gell-Mann's concept of effective complexity using Kolmogorov complexity, meaning the longer the instructions in a program is the more effective complex. The short in Kolmogorov means a program was built simple with a few instructions. However, if a program that captures the core structure and purpose with fewer steps proves to be more effective than the program with longer instruction. Effective complexity isn't about being simple or complicated. It's about how well something uses its parts to create something well-organized and interesting. It focuses on the meaningful information within a system.
<br>

Within a cute aesthetic frame, more than its appearance, cuteness taps into specific emotions and desires. With its innocence appearance, it conveys a particular message about a perfect world. This message is the meaningful information that makes cuteness effective in a capitalist system. Effective complexity is about how efficiently something uses its parts to create a desired outcome. Cute is highly effective because it uses simple visual cues (large, round eyes, soft, etc) to trigger complex emotions (adoration and possession) and drives consumption. Capitalism exploits this efficiency to manipulate our emotions and makes us buy cute products.
