**1. What aspects of the process were frustrating?**
<br>
Live coding has been a stressful experience for me, especially as a beginner. The unexpectation and messiness when being live where dealing unexpected errors in front of someone is nerve-wracking. A constrain of time where working within a limited time frame during a live coding is also challenging. Finally, the whole thing can feel really vulnerable, especially since I'm still learning to code and putting my skills on display can be intimidating.
<br>
<br>

**2. What aspects of the process were rewarding?**
<br>
New and unexpectation encourages exploration and trying out new things in discovering unexpected results. There's a unique satisfaction in achieving a result through this kind of exploration, rather than following a perfectly refined process.

**3. What you think the live-coding community are trying to do, and why**
<br>
By live-coding, coders can demonstrate their thought process and coding techniques in real-time. This allows viewers to learn by watching, asking questions, and seeing how problems are tackled step-by-step. It is also interactive where viewers can offer suggestions and feedback. This creates a collaborative learning environment. The live format can encourage experimentation and exploration. Coders might attempt new coding challenges or frameworks on stream, potentially leading to innovative solutions or unexpected discoveries. It offers an opportunity to learn from others' successes and mistakes in real-time. This approach breaks away from the polished presentations often found in traditional educational materials, providing a more authentic and relatable learning experience. It allows viewers to witness the thought processes behind coding decisions, including troubleshooting and problem-solving steps, which can be incredibly insightful and inspiring.
