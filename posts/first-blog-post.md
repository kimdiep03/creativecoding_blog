<p>I wanted to copy this (https://www.nearnext.com/) work from RafaÃ«l Rozendaa. But, I failed to do the gradient animation because I cannot figure out how to do that.</p>

**Process**

<p>I laid all the rectangles into places first for the layout. Then, to fill gradient color in later. But, what I thought was wrong. Creating gradient blocks in this was harder than I thought...</p>

<p>Then I was playing around map function for a while, and still trying to figure out how to do gradient.</p>

<p>Then, I found a tutorial that uses _lerpColor function_ and map function to do gradient that I can mostly understand.</p>

<p>I can created gradient but struggled to place the gradient into blocks and move the as shapes. As I understand, it was because the gradient was drawn by lines using loops.</p>

<p>I divided them into 4 to play around and see what can I do with them. They cannot do anything, but I'm getting there.</p>

<p>Then, I have this gradient color by changing the color from this to that in 4 divided parts. Then, I followed the tutorial to put the gradient into class in another file, and from that put it into blocks and call the gradient blocks in sketch.js later...</p>

<p>But, I also failed to do that =).</p>
