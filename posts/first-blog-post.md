<p>I wanted to copy this (https://www.nearnext.com/) work from Rafaël Rozendaa. But, I failed to do the gradient animation because I cannot figure out how to do that.</p>

<p>I laid all the rectangles into places first for the layout. Then, to fill gradient color in later. But, what I thought was wrong. Creating gradient blocks in this was harder than I thought...</p>

<p>Then I was playing around map function for a while, and still trying to figure out how to do gradient.</p>

<p>Then, I found a tutorial that uses lerpColor function and map function to do gradient that I can mostly understand.</p>

<p>I can created gradient but struggled to place the gradient into blocks and move the as shapes. As I understand, it was because the gradient was drawn by lines using loops.</p>

<p>I divided them into 4 to play around and see what can I do with them. They cannot do anything, but I'm getting there.</p>

<p>Then, I have this gradient color by changing the color from this to that in 4 divided parts. Then, I followed the tutorial to put the gradient into class in another file, and from that put it into blocks and call the gradient blocks in sketch.js later...</p>

<p>But, I also failed to do that =).</p>

<p>Then I duplicated more gradients and tried to draw them from this point to another point on the canvas, and it seemed to be fine. And I worked on that but haven't really figured out how to animate the gradient yet. 
<br>
<br>
My initial thought of how did Rafaël Rozendaa do this was (1) creating the gradient, (2.1) put them into blocks which can be translated, move around, or flipped, or (2.2) created the 2 kind of gradients, one horizontally linear and one vertically linear, manually like I did, (3) animate the lines of gradient to move while changing color?</p>
