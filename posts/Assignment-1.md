<div align="center">
    I chose to respond to this work (https://www.futureisuncertain.com/) by Rafaël Rozendaal. 
</div>
<br>

**1. What about the work makes it belong to the aesthetic category of "cute"?**

Rafaël's use of color in this work is cute. The bright, saturated hues adorning the vertically sliding trapezoids create a sense of playful innocence. However, this facade belies the underlying uncertainty. Each step forward, like the movement of the trapezoids, feels like a journey towards the unknown, a magical place that might not exist. This contradiction – the innocent appearance contrasted with the anxiety of an uncertain future – is what elevates the message. The randomness (chaos) in this work is the randomness of colors.  

**2. How does the artist employ effective complexity in the work to achieve its aesthetic result?**

 Rafaël's use of simple visual elements (color, shape, and composition) effectively evokes a sense of anxiety about the unknown future. His work captures the feeling of precariously walking a narrow path, an ocean below. We're left uncertain of the next step, portraying the anxieties of an uncertain future.

# Creative Process
**1. What attributes of the original work would you like to retain? What aspects would you like to improve / change?**

I would like to respond to Rafaël's work with 'and' that continue what he said: 'future is uncertain...and death is the only thing that is certain'.

I would like to keep the vertically sliding trapezoids and add in my response. Ideally, the work is like looking down while walking then I would like to add a look up, then we can see the end of the journey, which is death. 

**2. In what way is your work in dialogue with the Rozendaal piece you have chosen?**

I would like to respond to Rafaël's work with 'and' that continue what he said: 'future is uncertain...and death is the only thing that is certain'. 

**3. Document and discuss how the javascript techniques and design concepts you are using contribute to the aesthetic register of your response.**
