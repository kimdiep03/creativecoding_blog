# Discussion
<div align="center">
    I chose to respond to this work (https://www.futureisuncertain.com/) by RafaÃ«l Rozendaal
</div>
1. What about the work makes it belong to the aesthetic category of "cute"?

2. How does the artist employ effective complexity in the work to achieve its aesthetic result?
